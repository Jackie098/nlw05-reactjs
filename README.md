## Starting

  **1º** Clone the project and install dependencies (with YARN):  
  > yarn 

  **2º** Once installed all dependencies, you will need *json-server* as the extension of development to run an artificial server.  
  > yarn add json-server -D

   After installing it, just run the following command as it is already configured in *package.json*. This is the API server which is located at the root of the project.  
  > yarn server

  **3º** With the API server running, now you need to run the react/next server with:  
  > yarn dev

  **4º** In your browser, refer to *localhost/3000* to access the site.

## How to use
 
  **1º** On the *home* page without mystery you will have practically all the features. Just click the play button to play a podcast. With the auxiliary buttons, it is possible to pass and return audio, shuffle and repeat a specific podcast:  
  ![Home](https://github.com/Jackie098/nlw05-reactjs/blob/main/images-readme/home.png)

  **2º** When you click on the title of a podcast, you will be redirected to its page that contains details about it and you will be able to play it:
